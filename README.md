JavaFX practice

This is my personal project that basically performs some book-keeping. It is purely written in Java specifically using JavaFX library.
The app is modeled to store data about some given items e.g hotel menu items and tables to store the data about sales of the items.
I used javafx tables to store the sales by mantaining all data in arraylists. I intend to use MySQl in the future. Data structures used 
include Arraylists, HashTables e.t.c. I also used SceneBuilder to assist me in the frontend structure. There's also some simple CSS for
aesthetic appeal. The app is still in progress as I am working on it alone so as to prove to myself I can do it. 
I am a self-taught learner with much passion in solving software related problems. Thank you!
